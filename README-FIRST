   The compressed tar file "PREDICTIONS.tar.gz" contains
the various programs and script files required to run the 
molpak/pmin structure prediction procedures. 

   Do the following... 
(1) gunzip PREDICTIONS.tar.gz.
(2) tar -xvf PREDICTIONS.tar

   These steps create the "PREDUCTIONS" directory which will contain
the "MOLPAK", "PMIN","UTILITIES", and "new-U" subdirectories and several files.  

   The PREDICTIONS directory and Each of the subdirectories contains "compile-all" 
files to compile and link programs in the various directories.

   Before compiling, etc, you must replace the name of our compiler with
the name of your compile in all of the compile-all files.  We use "lf95".  

   There are several programs and scripts in the UTILITIES subdirectory.  It
is necessary to change the name "PREDICTIONS" to the name of the directory
in which the programs, etc will reside for subsequent execution.  For example, 
our directory is named "/export/software/PREDICTIONS".  
This is done by the following steps -->
  (1) replace "lf95" with your compiler's name in compile-all in the top
directory, here assumed to be PREDICTIONS  
  (2) copy all files in new-U to UTILITIES --> "cp new-U/* UTILITIES/."
  (3) ./compile-all --> compiles and links the program "renaname-dir.f90"
  (4) ./rename-dir.com --> this changes all the occurences of "PREDICTIONS" in
      the needed files in UTILITIES to "/export/software/PREDICTIONS"
      or whatever directory you happen to be in when you do ./rename-dir.com.

   Establish the following aliases... 

 alias  transform /export/software/PREDICTIONS/UTILITIES/transform.exe
 alias  prepare-files /export/software/PREDICTIONS/UTILITIES/prepare-files.exe
 alias  make-files /export/software/PREDICTIONS/UTILITIES/make-files.com
 alias  chem3d /export/software/PREDICTIONS/UTILITIES/chem3d.exe
 alias  summarize /export/software/PREDICTIONS/UTILITIES/summarize_tab.com
 alias  resort-summarize /export/software/PREDICTIONS/UTILITIES/resort-summarize.com
    
   The aliases facilitate executing the various calculations.  For example, to perform
molpak/pmin icalculations, just type "make-files" and answer the questions that follow.   

EXAMPLES are provided.    GOOD LUCK!
